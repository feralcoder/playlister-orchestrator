OpenStack Heat has come to replace that.

Some OpenStack management will be necessary for ongoing playlister management, but:

2) The python OpenStack libraries are sad.
2a) Inconsistent Auth: looks different between nova / neutron / octavia / etc.
2b) Inconsistent Structures: same-named commands return classes, lists, whatever between diff't OS systems.
